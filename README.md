# ImageToLaTex
This project finetunes Qwen2, a powerful multilingual large language model developed by Alibaba, for generating LaTeX mathematical formulas from images. This project demonstrates the integration of the Qwen2-7B-Instruct model for LaTeX content generation, enabling users to convert natural language prompts into well-structured LaTeX code. By leveraging the instruction-following capabilities of Qwen2, the notebook simplifies the process of writing mathematical expressions, scientific documentation, and academic reports, making it especially useful for students, researchers, and educators who work extensively with LaTeX.
